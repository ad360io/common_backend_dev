## Getting Started

The general set up is Conda Python 2.7.13 with Django 1.10.5. 

You may want to follow http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/pinax_starter_projects/ to set up Pinax. Then since the database is included, you should be able to directly run python manage.py runserver.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py runserver
```
